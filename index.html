   <h2><center>Reflection</center></h2>

   <p><center>Before starting the first year at the university I did not have any experience with graphic
     design course (specially creating websites by coding), even if from always I was finding it extremely
      interesting. The last year when I was in the college, I had a chance to use Adobe programs,
       especially the ones related to media such as Premiere Pro and After Effects. Rarely I was using 
       as well Adobe programs such as Illustrator or Photoshop. Thanks to that I did not have any issues
        with creating my typographic project. I was finding that task very relaxing also I had a
         chance to present my creativity. On creating my typographic project I spent the most of time 
         and same goes with creating a website. Even if from the start of first semester I was finding 
         the graphic design course interesting ,at the same time I knew to understand some steps in that 
         course I will have to spend more time. The great example was creating a website by coding.
          That is because before first year I never had a chance to do stuff like this, everything seemed
           for me to be confusing, even the process of connecting the Github program to the 
           VisualStudios was complicated for me. For the first three weeks I was finding this whole thing
            overwhelming. Furthermore, when we were required to start planning/creating a layout for our
             websites I started going through the coding worksheets again, however this time I started 
             finally understanding the process of making them. Also, a really important thing to highlight
              is that the weekly coding worksheets helped me extremely with creating my own website.
               Especially when it comes about decorating/precising it. The task which surprised me because
                at the start I thought that the process of making it is going to be easy, however after
                 time it turned out to be challenging was a process of creating three posters about 
                 skateboarding (CARP). The reason why I was thinking that this project is going to be easy
                  was because I already had an experience with using the Adobe Photoshop program and 
                  Illustration, because of that fact I was expecting the Indesign program is going to work
                   the same/similar way. However, from the start I was struggling with using it; the great
                    example is when I wanted to remove a background from the image which I wanted to use
                     for my first poster. To solve out the problem I had to watch the Youtube video.
                      Nonetheless even if I was finding the process of creating this work hard at the 
                      beginning, I was finding it useful at the same time. That is because I knew it is
                       going to help me in the future when I am going to be required to work for the
                        professional clients. This task gave me a chance to get ready for the further
                         tasks which I will have to do. So far, I enjoyed the first semester of graphic
                          design course and I am looking forward to start the next project in the second 
                          semester. Even if I started the university not a long time ago, I can already 
                          see a huge improvement in my computer skills, especially the ones with coding
                          . </center></p>

      <li>Dilatational</li>
      <p>Every element in a dilational typographic system grows in a circular pattern from a central point.
        Random system components don't seem to follow any particular pattern.
      </p>
      <img src="3.png" class="center">
      <li>Random</li>
      <p>The elements are arranged freely by the random system, they have no clear goal,

      <img src="4.png" class="center">
      <li>Grid</li>
      <p>The grids are effective on books,posters, websites and many more. a grid is a set of
        invisible lines, either vertical or horizontal; that divide a page into pieces.
        There are rarely any problems with readbility of grid text.

      <h2>CARP</h2>
      <h3>I have created three different posters about the Skateboarding  by using
        the Adobe Indesign. In each one of my work my intention was to present in the 
        clear and presentable way the theme of posters and what story they are  telling for the target
         audience.</h3>
      <li>Poster 1</li>
      
          <img src="3a.png" class="center">
          <p>The first poster which I have created is my the least favourite one, that is because it looks
             simple. Before starting the university I have never had a chance to use the Adobe Indesign
              program. Because of that we can notice a lot of empty spaces around the character.
               Also after creating the rest two posters I have realised that some information written on 
               the first poster are hard to read neither because of the size or colour. Thanks to creating
                the first poster I had a chance to gain a knowledge about using the Indesign program and 
                to experiment with some options (little dots around the character) which I have used for 
                the rest of my posters. Furthermore the most noticeable thing which person can notice is 
                that instead of using a basic picture of a girl skateboarding ,I have decided to by using
                 a pen only present her movements. Thanks to this idea the poster might look more standing
                  out, and the main picture( of skateboarding girl) is matching more nicely with the rest
                   of the poster when it comes about the colour scheme .</p>
                   <li> Poster 2</li>
                   <img src="2a.png" class="center">
                   <p>For creating the second poster I have decided to go for something compeletely 
                    different comparing to my first work. This time I have decided to use the actual 
                    picture of a girl skating (we can see her face), the only thing which I changed in 
                    it was cutting off the background. Also I wanted to experiment with changing the 
                    shapes of text to make it even more eye-catching for the target audience. The most 
                    challenging thing which I had a chance to experience while making it was cutting off 
                    the background from a picture with a girl. That is because the function of dong it 
                    works completely different comparing to the Adobe Illustrator.</p>
                    <li>Poster 3</li>
                    <img src="1a.png" class="center">
                    <p> The third poster which I have created looks similar to the first work which I 
                      have made. That is because I liked the first design of my  however, after a time 
                      of using the Adobe Indesign I improved my skills of using this program. Thanks that
                       I have decided to use some details which I was using in my first work ,to develop
                        them even more. The great example is where in the first poster instead of using 
                        the actual picture of a girl skateboarding by using a pen I only presented her 
                        movements, meanwhile in the third poster I have decided to create exactly the 
                        same effect by using more pictures. Thanks to that the target audience will notice
                         even more clearly the theme of my poster without even reading any information.</p>

                    <li> Upgrading The Chosen Poster</li>
                    <img src="ff2.png" class="center">
                    <p>From my three created posters I had to choose a one of them which might be the most
                       interesting and the best for the target audience. However, after choosing the best
                        poster I will have to develop and precise it even more.Instead of choosing it on my
                         own , I have decided that the best thing is going to ask someone for their 
                         opinion (GIGI). In his opinion the best poster which I have made is the second 
                         one. That is because you can see very clearly the theme of the poster (what the 
                         girl is actually doing on it) because on the rest of the posters even if you can
                          see the movements of the girl , you can only guess what she is doing there.
                           Also all the colours which I have used for this specific poster work well 
                            with each other. However, the thing which I had to improve was a text, 
                            that is because some if them were not easy/clear to read. Especially 
                            the title in the black colour which was blending with the dark purple 
                            background. To make the poster even more readable I have changed the size
                             and a colour for a white when of text which was presenting the dates of 
                             skateboarding event. I like even more the updated version of my poster,
                              after changing some details in my work there should not be any issues for 
                              target audience while reading it.</p>
