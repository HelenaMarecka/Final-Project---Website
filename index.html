      <h2>Typographic Project </h2>
      <li>Axial</li>
      <p> Every element is arranged along a single axis, either on its left or right.
        The information is presented separately to attract the viewer's attention and boost 
        its appeal.</p>

      <img src="1.png" class="center">
      <li>Radial</li>
      <p> Every element in the radial system is arranged to radiate like rays from a central point
        of emphasis.</p>
     <img src="2.png" class="center">
      <li>Dilatational</li>
      <p>Every element in a dilational typographic system grows in a circular pattern from a central point.
        Random system components don't seem to follow any particular pattern.
      </p>
      <img src="3.png" class="center">
      <li>Random</li>
      <p>The elements are arranged freely by the random system, they have no clear goal,
         direction or pattern.</p>
      <img src="4.png" class="center">
      <li>Grid</li>
      <p>The grids are effective on books,posters, websites and many more. a grid is a set of
        invisible lines, either vertical or horizontal; that divide a page into pieces.
        There are rarely any problems with readbility of grid text.
      </p>

      <li>Modular</li>
      <p>An alphabet made up of a restricted set of forms, or modules ,is called
        a modular typerface.
      </p>
      <img src="6.png" class="center">
      <li>Transitional</li>
      <p>Lacks edge alignments and axis relationships, allowing the pieces to
        move freely.It works well for creating posters and book covers.
      </p>
      <img src="7.png" class="center">
      <li>Bilateral</li>
      <p> A collection of standardised units that are non-objective. every word
        is positioned symmetrically along one axis.

      <h2>CARP</h2>
      <h3>Poster 1</h3>
      <h3>I have created three different posters about the Skateboarding  by using
         the Adobe Indesign. In each one of my work my intention was to present in the 
         clear and presentable way the theme of posters and what story they are  telling for the target
          audience.</h3>
          <img src="3a.png" class="center">
          <p>The first poster which I have created is my the least favourite one, that is because it looks
             simple. Before starting the university I have never had a chance to use the Adobe Indesign
              program. Because of that we can notice a lot of empty spaces around the character.
               Also after creating the rest two posters I have realised that some information written on 
               the first poster are hard to read neither because of the size or colour. Thanks to creating
                the first poster I had a chance to gain a knowledge about using the Indesign program and 
                to experiment with some options (little dots around the character) which I have used for 
                the rest of my posters. Furthermore the most noticeable thing which person can notice is 
                that instead of using a basic picture of a girl skateboarding ,I have decided to by using
                 a pen only present her movements. Thanks to this idea the poster might look more standing
                  out, and the main picture( of skateboarding girl) is matching more nicely with the rest
                   of the poster when it comes about the colour scheme .</p>
                   <h3> Poster 2</h3>
                   <img src="2a.png" class="center">
                   <p>For creating the second poster I have decided to go for something compeletely 
                    different comparing to my first work. This time I have decided to use the actual 
                    picture of a girl skating (we can see her face), the only thing which I changed in 
                    it was cutting off the background. Also I wanted to experiment with changing the 
                    shapes of text to make it even more eye-catching for the target audience. The most 
                    challenging thing which I had a chance to experience while making it was cutting off 
                    the background from a picture with a girl. That is because the function of dong it 
                    works completely different comparing to the Adobe Illustrator.</p>
