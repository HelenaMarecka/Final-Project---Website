   <h2><center>Reflection</center></h2>

   <p><center>Before starting the first year at the university I did not have any experience with graphic
     design course (specially creating websites by coding), even if from always I was finding it extremely
      interesting. The last year when I was in the college, I had a chance to use Adobe programs,
       especially the ones related to media such as Premiere Pro and After Effects. Rarely I was using 
       as well Adobe programs such as Illustrator or Photoshop. Thanks to that I did not have any issues
        with creating my typographic project. I was finding that task very relaxing also I had a
         chance to present my creativity. <center></p>
         
          <center></p>On creating my typographic project I spent the most of time 
         and same goes with creating a website. Even if from the start of first semester I was finding 
         the graphic design course interesting ,at the same time I knew to understand some steps in that 
         course I will have to spend more time. The great example was creating a website by coding.
          That is because before first year I never had a chance to do stuff like this, everything seemed
           for me to be confusing, even the process of connecting the Github program to the 
           VisualStudios was complicated for me. For the first three weeks I was finding this whole thing
            overwhelming. Furthermore, when we were required to start planning/creating a layout for our
             websites I started going through the coding worksheets again, however this time I started 
             finally understanding the process of making them. Also, a really important thing to highlight
              is that the weekly coding worksheets helped me extremely with creating my own website.
               Especially when it comes about decorating/precising it. <center></p>
              
                <center></p>The task which surprised me because at the start I thought that the process of making it is going to be easy, however after
                 time it turned out to be challenging was a process of creating three posters about 
                 skateboarding (CARP). The reason why I was thinking that this project is going to be easy
                  was because I already had an experience with using the Adobe Photoshop program and 
                  Illustration, because of that fact I was expecting the Indesign program is going to work
                   the same/similar way. However, from the start I was struggling with using it; the great
                    example is when I wanted to remove a background from the image which I wanted to use
                     for my first poster. To solve out the problem I had to watch the Youtube video.
                      Nonetheless even if I was finding the process of creating this work hard at the 
                      beginning, I was finding it useful at the same time. That is because I knew it is
                       going to help me in the future when I am going to be required to work for the
                        professional clients. This task gave me a chance to get ready for the further
                         tasks which I will have to do.<center></p> 
                         
                          <center></p>So far, I enjoyed the first semester of graphic
                          design course and I am looking forward to start the next project in the second 
                          semester. Even if I started the university not a long time ago, I can already 
                          see a huge improvement in my computer skills, especially the ones with coding
                          . </center></p>

      <h2>CARP</h2>
      <h3>I have created three different posters about the Skateboarding  by using
        the Adobe Indesign. In each one of my work my intention was to present in the 
        clear and presentable way the theme of posters and what story they are  telling for the target
         audience.</h3>
      <li>Poster 1</li>
      
          <img src="3a.png" class="center">
          <p>The first poster which I have created is my the least favourite one, that is because it looks
             simple. Before starting the university I have never had a chance to use the Adobe Indesign
              program. Because of that we can notice a lot of empty spaces around the character.
               Also after creating the rest two posters I have realised that some information written on 
               the first poster are hard to read neither because of the size or colour. Thanks to creating
                the first poster I had a chance to gain a knowledge about using the Indesign program and 
                to experiment with some options (little dots around the character) which I have used for 
                the rest of my posters. Furthermore the most noticeable thing which person can notice is 
                that instead of using a basic picture of a girl skateboarding ,I have decided to by using
                 a pen only present her movements. Thanks to this idea the poster might look more standing
                  out, and the main picture( of skateboarding girl) is matching more nicely with the rest
                   of the poster when it comes about the colour scheme .</p>
                   <li> Poster 2</li>
                   <img src="2a.png" class="center">
                   <p>For creating the second poster I have decided to go for something compeletely 
                    different comparing to my first work. This time I have decided to use the actual 
                    picture of a girl skating (we can see her face), the only thing which I changed in 
                    it was cutting off the background. Also I wanted to experiment with changing the 
                    shapes of text to make it even more eye-catching for the target audience. The most 
                    challenging thing which I had a chance to experience while making it was cutting off 
                    the background from a picture with a girl. That is because the function of dong it 
                    works completely different comparing to the Adobe Illustrator.</p>
                    <li>Poster 3</li>
                    <img src="1a.png" class="center">
                    <p> The third poster which I have created looks similar to the first work which I 
                      have made. That is because I liked the first design of my  however, after a time 
                      of using the Adobe Indesign I improved my skills of using this program. Thanks that
                       I have decided to use some details which I was using in my first work ,to develop
                        them even more. The great example is where in the first poster instead of using 
                        the actual picture of a girl skateboarding by using a pen I only presented her 
                        movements, meanwhile in the third poster I have decided to create exactly the 
                        same effect by using more pictures. Thanks to that the target audience will notice
                         even more clearly the theme of my poster without even reading any information.</p>

                    <li> Upgrading The Chosen Poster</li>
                    <img src="ff2.png" class="center">
                    <p>From my three created posters I had to choose a one of them which might be the most
                       interesting and the best for the target audience. However, after choosing the best
                        poster I will have to develop and precise it even more.Instead of choosing it on my
                         own , I have decided that the best thing is going to ask someone for their 
                         opinion (GIGI). In his opinion the best poster which I have made is the second 
                         one. That is because you can see very clearly the theme of the poster (what the 
                         girl is actually doing on it) because on the rest of the posters even if you can
                          see the movements of the girl , you can only guess what she is doing there.
                           Also all the colours which I have used for this specific poster work well 
                            with each other. However, the thing which I had to improve was a text, 
                            that is because some if them were not easy/clear to read. Especially 
                            the title in the black colour which was blending with the dark purple 
                            background. To make the poster even more readable I have changed the size
                             and a colour for a white when of text which was presenting the dates of 
                             skateboarding event. I like even more the updated version of my poster,
                              after changing some details in my work there should not be any issues for 
                              target audience while reading it.</p>

      <h2>Coding Project</h2>
      <h3>The whole coding project work was made by following the weekly coding worksheets. </h3>
  

       <h3><li> Week 1-2</li></h3>
       <p><a href="https://helenamarecka.github.io/Coding-Worksheet-Week-2/">pizza website week 1-2</a></p>
      <img src="pizza.jpg" class="center">
      <p>For the first two weeks I’ve had a chance to learn the basic stuff when it
         comes about creating website by coding. On the first week of following the 
         coding worksheet we were required to connect the Github program to our non 
         existing back then website. Now when I am looking at the first worksheet I 
         am finding it extremely simple and easy. However, back them I was struggling
          with it a lot. That is because before starting this course I never had a 
          chance to code and use the Github program. On the second worksheet we had a 
          chance to learn how to add text and images. Still back then I was struggling
           with that step. Furthermore now I don’t have any problems with making it.
            I was finding that worksheet extremely helpful.</p>

      <h3><li> Cake Week 3 </li></h3>
      <p><a href="        https://helenamarecka.github.io/coding-worksheet-week-3">cake week 3</a></p>

      <img src="cake.png" class="center">
      For the week 3 we were required to precise our page, by changing the colour of
       background and making the size of paragraphs bigger. The first part of this
        worksheet I was finding easy however, at the end our task was to create the 
        another new page (this time about cakes) and connect it with a pizza website 
        (which I created before). This step I was finding extremely confusing and 
        I spent a lot of time on completing this step. However, at the same time 
        after figuring out how to make this step I had a chance to improve my coding 
        skills when it comes about creating and improving your website for future
         tasks.
      


      <h3><li> Flexbox-Rundown Week 4-5 </li></h3>
      <p><a href="https://helenamarecka.github.io/flexbox-rundown">flexbox-rundown week 4-5</a></p>
      <img src="flexbox.png" class="center">
      <img src="flexbox1.png" class="center">
      The week 4 and 5 I was finding the most challenging, that is because we were 
      required to create buttons which would sync to our pages also we had to publish
       videos from Youtube but at the same time I was finding it extremely helpful.
        That is because before starting a coding worksheet 4 I completely did not
         know how to create this type of functions. I am really happy that I had a 
         chance to learn this type of stuff because definitely this skill is going 
         to help me with my future projects.I’ve had a chance to use a lot of 
         elements/details from these two worksheets to create and precise some details
          for my website. Definitely I can see a huge improvement in my coding skills
           from week 1 and the current ones. At the start of week one I completely 
           did not know how to use the the GitHub program and to make a website by 
           coding, meanwhile now I feel confident from making this type of stuff.
